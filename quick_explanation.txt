Sure! Let's walk through each line of this code, starting from the imports.

Imports and Setup
python
Copy code
import random
import timeit
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000)  # or a higher value
import random – This imports the random module, which is used to select a random pivot in the randomized_partition function.
import timeit – The timeit module is used to measure the execution time of code snippets, which is useful for comparing the performance of deterministic and randomized quicksort.
import sys – The sys module provides access to system-specific parameters and functions.
sys.setrecursionlimit(1000000) – Sets a high recursion limit to allow Quick Sort to work on large arrays without hitting a recursion depth limit in Python. Quick Sort is recursive, and large arrays need deep recursion to fully sort.
Deterministic Partition Function
python
Copy code
def deterministic_partition(arr, low, high):
    pivot = arr[high]
    i = low - 1
def deterministic_partition(arr, low, high): – Defines the function that performs a deterministic partition by always selecting the last element as the pivot.
pivot = arr[high] – Sets the pivot as the last element of the array (at index high).
i = low - 1 – Initializes i to one position before the low index. i will track where the smaller elements (relative to the pivot) should go.
python
Copy code
    for j in range(low, high):
        if arr[j] < pivot:
            i += 1
            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
for j in range(low, high): – Loops through the array from low to high - 1.
if arr[j] < pivot: – Checks if the current element is smaller than the pivot.
i += 1 – Increments i to make space for a smaller element.
arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i] – Swaps the current element (arr[j]) with the element at index i, moving the smaller element to the left side of the array.
python
Copy code
    arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1]
    return i + 1
arr[i + 1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i + 1] – Places the pivot in its correct position by swapping it with the element at i + 1.
return i + 1 – Returns the index of the pivot's final position, which is used to divide the array for recursive sorting.
Randomized Partition Function
python
Copy code
def randomized_partition(arr, low, high):
    pivot_index = random.randint(low, high)
    arr[pivot_index], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[pivot_index]
    return deterministic_partition(arr, low, high)
def randomized_partition(arr, low, high): – Defines a partition function that randomizes the pivot selection.
pivot_index = random.randint(low, high) – Selects a random index between low and high as the pivot index.
arr[pivot_index], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[pivot_index] – Swaps the randomly chosen pivot element with the last element.
return deterministic_partition(arr, low, high) – Calls deterministic_partition to complete the partitioning around this random pivot.
Quick Sort Function
python
Copy code
def quick_sort(arr, low, high, pivot_selector):
    if low < high:
        pivot_index = pivot_selector(arr, low, high)
        quick_sort(arr, low, pivot_index - 1, pivot_selector)
        quick_sort(arr, pivot_index + 1, high, pivot_selector)
def quick_sort(arr, low, high, pivot_selector): – Defines the Quick Sort function, which takes an array, bounds (low and high), and a pivot selection function (pivot_selector).
if low < high: – Checks if there are more than one elements to sort.
pivot_index = pivot_selector(arr, low, high) – Calls the chosen partition function to get the pivot index.
quick_sort(arr, low, pivot_index - 1, pivot_selector) – Recursively sorts the left part of the array.
quick_sort(arr, pivot_index + 1, high, pivot_selector) – Recursively sorts the right part of the array.
Main Program Logic
python
Copy code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    arr_sizes = [100, 1000, 5000]
    for size in arr_sizes:
        arr = [random.randint(1, 1000) for _ in range(size)]
        arr.sort(reverse=True)
if __name__ == "__main__": – Ensures that this code runs only when executed as a script.
arr_sizes = [100, 1000, 5000] – Sets different array sizes for performance testing.
for size in arr_sizes: – Loops through each array size to perform the test.
arr = [random.randint(1, 1000) for _ in range(size)] – Generates an array of random integers from 1 to 1000 of the given size.
arr.sort(reverse=True) – Sorts the array in descending order to create a scenario that Quick Sort may need more time to handle (a “worst-case” setup).
python
Copy code
        deterministic_time = timeit.timeit("quick_sort(arr.copy(), 0, len(arr) - 1, deterministic_partition)", globals=globals(),number=10)
        
        randomized_time = timeit.timeit("quick_sort(arr.copy(), 0, len(arr) - 1, randomized_partition)", globals=globals(), number=10)
deterministic_time = timeit.timeit(...) – Times the deterministic Quick Sort function for this array size over 10 runs.
randomized_time = timeit.timeit(...) – Times the randomized Quick Sort function for this array size over 10 runs.
python
Copy code
        print(f"Array size: {size}")
        print(f"Deterministic Quick Sort time: {deterministic_time:.6f} seconds")
        print(f"Randomized Quick Sort time: {randomized_time:.6f} seconds")
        print("-" * 40)
print(f"Array size: {size}") – Prints the size of the array.
print(f"Deterministic Quick Sort time: {deterministic_time:.6f} seconds") – Prints the time taken by deterministic Quick Sort.
print(f"Randomized Quick Sort time: {randomized_time:.6f} seconds") – Prints the time taken by randomized Quick Sort.
print("-" * 40) – Prints a separator line for readability.
